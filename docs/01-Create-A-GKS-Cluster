### 1. Creating a cluster

```bash
gcloud container clusters create kubia-v2 \
  --num-nodes 1 \
  --machine-type e2-small \
  --region us-west1 \
  --enable-ip-alias \
  --enable-private-nodes \
  --master-ipv4-cidr 172.16.0.32/28 \
  --disk-size 50 \
  --disk-type pd-standard
```

This `gcloud` command is creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster named `kubia-v2` with specific configurations. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each part of the command:

#### Command Breakdown:

1. **Cluster Creation**:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters create kubia-v2
   ```
   - This command creates a GKE cluster named `kubia-v2`.

2. **Number of Nodes**:
   ```bash
   --num-nodes 3
   ```
   - The cluster will have **3 worker nodes** in its default node pool. Each node is a virtual machine (VM) that runs Kubernetes workloads (pods).

3. **Machine Type**:
   ```bash
   --machine-type e2-small
   ```
   - Specifies that each node will use the **`e2-small`** machine type, which provides:
     - 2 vCPUs
     - 2 GB of memory
   - This machine type is cost-effective and suitable for lightweight workloads.

4. **Region**:
   ```bash
   --region us-west1
   ```
   - The cluster is deployed in the **`us-west1`** region. This defines where the nodes and control plane (master) will reside. Choosing a region close to your users can reduce latency.

5. **Enable IP Alias (VPC-native Cluster)**:
   ```bash
   --enable-ip-alias
   ```
   - This flag enables **VPC-native networking** for the cluster, allowing Kubernetes Pods to use internal IP addresses from a **Google Cloud VPC**. This provides better scalability and network performance.
   - Pods get their own unique IP addresses from a reserved IP range, instead of being NATed behind node IPs.

6. **Private Nodes (No External IP on Nodes)**:
   ```bash
   --enable-private-nodes
   ```
   - This makes the nodes **private** by removing their external IP addresses. Nodes can only be accessed via internal IPs within the VPC.
   - It enhances security, as the nodes are not directly reachable from the internet.

7. ~Private Control Plane (Private Endpoint)~:
   ```bash
   --enable-private-endpoint
   ```
   - The control plane (master) will also have a **private IP address**, making it accessible only from within the VPC. This means you can’t access the Kubernetes API from the internet unless you're on the VPC or using a bastion host.
   - This improves security by preventing public access to the Kubernetes API.

8. **Master IP CIDR Range**:
   ```bash
   --master-ipv4-cidr 172.16.0.32/28
   ```
   - This specifies a **private CIDR block** (in this case, `172.16.0.32/28`) from which the control plane (master) IP will be assigned.
   - The control plane uses this private IP range to communicate with worker nodes and other components within the cluster.

9. **Disk Size**:
   ```bash
   --disk-size 50
   ```
   - Each node will have a **50 GB** persistent disk. This disk is used for local storage on the node, including the operating system, containers, and temporary pod data.
   - The default size is typically 100 GB, but reducing it to 50 GB helps save costs if your workloads don’t require much local storage.

10. **Disk Type**:
   ```bash
   --disk-type pd-standard
   ```
   - Specifies the disk type for the nodes as **standard persistent disk** (`pd-standard`), which is a cost-effective option compared to SSD disks (`pd-ssd`).
   - Standard disks are slower than SSDs but more affordable, suitable for workloads that don’t require high disk performance.

### Summary of What Happens:
- A **GKE cluster named `kubia-v2`** will be created in the **`us-west1`** region.
- The cluster will have **3 worker nodes**, each using **`e2-small`** machine types with **2 vCPUs and 2 GB of memory**.
- Each node will have a **50 GB standard persistent disk** for storage.
- **Private nodes** will be created (no external IPs on the nodes), and the **control plane** will also have a **private IP**, enhancing security.
- The cluster will be **VPC-native** (using IP aliasing), allowing for efficient networking with internal IP addresses from the VPC.
- A **private CIDR block** (`172.16.0.32/28`) will be used for control plane communication.

This setup is designed to be cost-effective while securing the cluster by restricting access to the internal VPC network only.

#### Accessing the cluster

To allow your public IP address to access the GKE control plane, you need to update the master authorized networks configuration for your cluster. 

```
➜  ~ gcloud container clusters update kubia-v3 \
    --region us-west1 \
    --enable-master-authorized-networks \
    --master-authorized-networks <Your-IP>/32
```
